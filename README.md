# VBA-challenge

The attached scripts loop through all of the stocks for the indicated year and outputs the ticker symbol, the yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, the percent change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, and the total stock volume associated with each ticker. 

The yearly change and percent change outputs are both rounded to two decimal places and the percent change outputs are followed by a % symbol. Additionally, the yearly change outputs are formatted such that cells are highlighted in green if they contain values greater than zero and highlighted in red if they contain values less than zero. 

The repository also contains screenshots of the outputs of each year.
